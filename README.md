We were a team of 5 from the Masai Web-15 batch who worked on cloning the www.snapdeal.com website as part of our Unit-3 construct week. As a team, we were given a project to clone the snapdeal.com. Our project demonstrates a basic flow of an e-commerce page, where a customer can Sign-up, Login, view and filter products, add their product to a cart and place his or her happy order.
